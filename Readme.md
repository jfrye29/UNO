## To Get UNO Working:

These are the tasks we need to do.

#### main.cpp

- (DONE) Add a prompt for how many users we want
- (DONE) Control to make the game end when a user has won
- A message for win the player wins
- (DONE) Add the special cards to the deck
- (DONE) Recycle the discarded deck when the draw deck goes empty

#### card.h

We need to add the following classes

* (DONE) reverse (should be easy)
* (DONE) skip (also relatively easy)
* (DONE) draw-2 (tad harder)
* (DONE) wild (hardest)

#### card.cpp

(DONE) In addition to implementing the classes above, we need to add the rendering functions.

I created a base rendering function to make life easier.

* Color cards
